-- has_permission(code): access comes ONLY from groups. True for an active
-- caller who is an admin (always, so an organization can never lock itself
-- out) or a member of a group of THEIR OWN organization that grants the code.
-- The role no longer grants anything by itself; role_permissions is kept only
-- as the template the default groups are seeded from (see below).
-- (Replaces the definition earlier in this file; everything that calls
-- has_permission, including every RLS policy, picks this up automatically.)
